## Things I learned

I learned how to create a modal form by using partial application of functions with one of its arguments partially applied. This allowed me to create 'factories' and helped keep my code DRY.

I was able to create responsive layout for the cards using auto-fill and minmax function instead of media queries. Additonal functionality to toggle a book's read status was done by passing `this` to select the current card instance and using the sibling and parent selector methods.
